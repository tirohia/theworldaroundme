    "Leasehold is a little different. The upfront sum is significantly less. There is a significant cost involved in the ground rent though. The upfront sum could be anywhere from 150 to 250k. On the face of it, it would be very easy to pay this off in a few years. Ground rent can easily add 300 pw to the costs though, making repayments smaller. Things to be wary about - when is the ground rent due for review, CVu had a thing last year where an extra 10K/year was added to the ground rent. A review just gone might make this an attractive option for a couple of years, or a review several years away, giving time to buy, recoup and sell with a signiicant period left before the next review - will be harder to sell if the next review is close.
